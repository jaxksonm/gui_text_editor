This program is a GUI text editor made in python using the tkinter import. 
Currently, the program allows users to change the font, size, and color of text.
This program is equipped with a find and replace tool, along with a timestamp insert. 
Users can also save their file. Word and character count is also displayed. 

This program allows users to upload the contents of the text file to a local and remote Git Hub repository.
The idea behind this would be to update a README document.
