This program is a GUI text editor made in python using the tkinter import. 
Currently, the program allows users to change the font, size, and color of text.
This program is equipped with a find and replace tool, along with a timestamp insert. 
Users can also save their file. Word and character count is also displayed. 

Git integration for this project is currently in the works. For now, it is mostly a demo mode. 

NOTE: Bug on linux operating systems where font menu closes if you do not hold the menu down with the mouse. 

Other bug on Linux operating systems where the font menu's dimensions are not large enough to display all fields.
"Light mode" is cut off unless window is expanded.
