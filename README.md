This program is a GUI text editor made in python using the tkinter import. 
Currently, the program allows users to change the font, size, and color of text.
This program is equipped with a find and replace tool, along with a timestamp insert. 
Users can also save their file. Word and character count is also displayed. 

NOTE: Bug on linux operating systems where font menu closes if you do not hold the menu down with the mouse.
